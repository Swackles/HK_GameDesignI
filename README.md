## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

For **Hardcore Tetris** you'll need to have:
1 . [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - You'll need this to run the server which this application uses to run.
2. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - This is the package manager this project is using.
3. [GIT Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is needed so you can download the project files.

<br />
<br />

#### Downoading Project Files

To download the project to your local machine you need to install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) to your local machine.
After you have installed the git bash to your machine start it and write to the command line
```bash
cd /d <The location on your PC you want the file to download to>
```
and then
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swackles/HK_HardcoreTetris.git
```
this will download the project to your local machine.

<br />
<br />

#### Setting up

Now that you have downloaded git repository you're almost ready to run the application. But first you need to install all of the dependencies this application uses. For that first go into the file.
```bash
cd HK_HardcoreTetris
```
Once you're in the directory with the code files you need to download all the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

If all goes well the dependencies are now all installed. Next up is just running the application.
```bash
node app
```
Now you're application should be running and by entering `localhost:5000` into the address bar you should see the game.
